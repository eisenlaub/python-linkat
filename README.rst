The single purpose of `python-linkat`_ is to provide python developers with
the ability to use the system native functions ``linkat`` and ``symlinkat``.
The Library is written in plain python and utilizes `cffi`_ to call native 
system functions and therefore depends on it.


Installation
------------
The package is available on `PyPI`_ and thus it can be installed with pip:

::

  $ pip install linkat
